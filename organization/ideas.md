# Ideas:

## Brainstorm
- grid? hexgrid?
- turn based?
- new mechanic?
- reveal a twist as you are playing the game?

## General:

- action packed gameplay
- turn based? no, it is supposed to be action packed
- bullet hell? 
- maybe zombies?
- progression type:
  - endless
  - levels
    - cannot do levels very well if the goal is to have fun shooting
- dont care about the story at all, mechanics are supposed to be the fun part
- controller support is important
- platforming?, focus on action
  - this would dictate side scroller maybe?
  - how would top down platformer look like?
    - oldschool Zelda
- no mouse input except start button (but that could also be pressed by keyboard/controller)
- 3D? it will feel cheap, but it has the most potential
  - keep in mind for after jam version
- if you throw a box, it will remain there
  - collision included
  - physics!

## Package man:
- packages as abilities:
  - multiple types of packages
    - timed grappling hook
    - flail/pickupable projectile
    - life package
    - movement package
    - goal package?
    - tower defense package?
    - package recall?
    - time stopping package?
    - mine package: after detonating it puts itself on cooldown, then reactivates itself
    - teleport package - maybe not, action is focus
  - package upgrades:
    - recall: returns package fast/instantly, no need to physically pick them up
  - package limit:
    - either certain amount of packages can be in the level
    - or every package type can be present in level only once
  - maybe
- idea: each package deals damage, only heavy damage package does something extra

- epics
  - platform collision movement
  - packages
  - upgrade system? (rather not, but seems obvious)
  - package unlocks? (rather not, but seems obvious)
  - enemies: design, logic, movement
  - package combos?
    - a lot of work cut out for me

- intro comic? a lot of work, short gameplay, maybe post jam
- replayability? 
  - time survival
  - probably dont want it, can be done post jam

### Conclusion
- lot of fun potential
- lot of work
- expandable
- original?

## Stack attack top down perspective
- dropping packages and dodging them, while being able to traverse only one step up
- seems frustrating and random, or maybe there should be abilities to delete a box in front of the character

### Conclusion
- small scope, somewhat fun

## Card game, packages
- every card is a package
- indirect combat, you attack territories
  - multiple possible design paths:
    - who deals the last damage wins
    - who deals the most damage wins (with packages that turn allegiance around)
- getting a territory unlocks cards
- who wins a board wins the game
